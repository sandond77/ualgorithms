// Write a recursive function called fib which acceps a number and retursn the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. Recall the that the fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole numbers 1,1,2,3,5,8 which starts with 1 and 1 and where every number therafter is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers. 

// fib(4) // 3
// fib(10) //55
// fib(28) // 317881
// fib(35) //9227465

function fib(){
	
}
